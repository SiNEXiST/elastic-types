 * * A field, `programming_languages`, contains a list of known programming languages,

 *  You can use the `terms_set` query to return documents that match at least two of these languages.
 * * A field, `permissions`, contains a list of possible user permissions for an application.
 *  You can use the `terms_set` query to return documents that match a subset of these permissions.
